# JavaScript Game - Scissors, Paper, Rock

> From The Odin Project's [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/rock-paper-scissors#assignment).

This project was my first experience in coding a game with JavaScript. You play the game against the computer who will randomly return either ‘Rock’, ‘Paper’ or ‘Scissors’. The game is a first to 5 competition, with results after each round and a live scoreboard.

## Code Review

The HTML and CSS were designed in Webflow and the JavaScript was written by hand. The CSS code could be improved by consolidating everything into one file and removing the irrelevant Webflow code from normalise.css and webflow.css file. The JavaScript could be improved by refactoring the code with loops to minimise code repetition.

Overall, I was happy with the result and the project is a nice introduction into using the DOM layer and JavaScript logic.
